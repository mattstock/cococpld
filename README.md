========

A complete bus interface design and floppy drive emulator for the Tandy Color Computer using Arduino/AVR!

This is a combined open source/open hardware project to design a development board for a variety of 8- and 16-bit
computers, starting with the Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer.

Videos of how these components work together are available at https://www.youtube.com/user/Greyhound716.

Directories:

firmware2 - AVR gcc project for the firmware to act as FDC and ROM programmer.
fpga - Altera Quartus project to implement the control logic for the board.
kicad - Kicad project including the schematics and board layout.
cpld - Some legacy stuff, for some earlier attempts to build the logic using small CPLDs.

A complete bus interface design for the Tandy Color Computer for Arduino/AVR!

The SPI branch is intended to replace the parallel interface to the uC with an
SPI interface.  It would act like a 64k serial memory chip.

This is a combined open source/open hardware project to design a development board for a variety of 8- and 16-bit
computers, starting with the Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer.

Fully populated boards are also available for purchase.  Contact stock@bexkat.com for details.

Videos of how these components work together are available at https://www.youtube.com/user/Greyhound716.

Directories:
